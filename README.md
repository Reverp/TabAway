# TabAway for Sublime Text 3
TabAway is a Sublime Text 3 plugin which allows you to close all files with a specific file extension at once.

# Installation
As of now, the only way to install TabAway is to clone this repository into your Sublime Text 3 Packages folder. TabAway is not yet submitted to the official Package Manager so this is the only way for now.

# Usage
To specify your desired file extensions, see Preferences -> Package Settings -> TabAway > Settings. You will see the following lines

`"tabaway_file_extensions"xml|txt"`

Provide the file extensions you want to close automatically. Use | (pipe) to provide multiple file extensions.
Currently, the only way to execute this plugin is to use the desired key combination (default: ctrl+alt+c). See Preferences -> Package Settings -> TabAway > Key Bindings to change this combination.
